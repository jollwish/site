					Nanoscience bridges the macroscopic world and the atomic/ molecular world and provides the ultimate control of materials' electrical and mechanical properties. By using this recently developed tool, novel devices and systems can be rationally designed to realize functions imagined before only in science fiction. We are particularly interested in applying nanoscience for three major fields: <b>Nanorobotics, Nanofluidics, Renewable Energy</b>.

					Electrochemical reactions in solution not only generate chemical products on the electrode's surface but also creating ionic flow between cathode and anode. At a microscopic scale, the mechanical force generated by this ionic flow is not negligible and can be used to propel nano/micro particles or pump solution around the electrode. This phenomenon has attracted much interest because of its potential applications in developing novel components in microrobots and in MEMS systems. However, in order to achieve high current density for large driven force, most nanomotors utilize a highly thermodynamically and kinetically favorable reaction such as hydrogen peroxide decomposition and/or hydrazine oxidation as its energy source. These harsh chemical conditions greatly limit the nanomotor's applications. We are developing highly controllable nanomotor which can operate in biocompatible electrolyte which could have potential application in microsurgery and directed drug delivery.

					Fluids in confined spaces have fundamentally different dynamics than bulk, which is not only scientifically interesting but also could be exploited in methods for DNA sequencing and single molecule biosensors. Particularly, nanopore technology is developed to sequence DNA/RNA by using electrophoresis to drive DNA molecules through nanometer-scale pores. However, the technology still faces extreme challenges in the accurate sequencing of individual DNA molecules. We are trying to develop new approach by using inorganic nanotube as an alternative and more feasible method to overcome the major hurdles towards the fast, low cost, and high quality genome typing, which would fundamentally change the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.

					<p style="margin:0"><b>High performance thermoelectric material</b></p>
					Thermoelectric materials hold great promise for increasing the efficiency of energy usage by directly harvesting electricity from otherwise wasted heat. However, current thermoelectric materials suffer from low efficiency, limited material supply and high manufacturing costs. We are developing high performance thermoelectric material with lower thermal conductivity and higher thermal power as by introducing nanostructures as well as chemical modifications to highly conductive semiconductor material.
